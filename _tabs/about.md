## Spyridon Eftychios Kokotos 

### Undergraduate Student @ Ionian University 
>> February 24, 2023

Welcome to my website! My name is Spyridon Eftychios Kokotos (aka Spyros) and I'm an undergraduate student at the Department of Informatics at the Ionian University. In February of 2023, I was awarded a scholarship from the Wikimedia Foundation in recognition of my contributions to the open-source community.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I'm also an active volunteer in various organizations. Since November of 2022, I have been a volunteer & an Activity Planning Member at the IEEE Student Branch of Ionian University, where I have had the opportunity to work with like-minded individuals on a variety of projects. Currently, I am organizing the 102th Conference of Rectors of the Greek Universities, which will be held in Corfu, Greece from March 20-23.

When I'm not studying or volunteering, you can find me sailing the seas, exploring new destinations, and experiencing the freedom of the open water. I believe that pursuing my passions and giving back to my community are essential components of a fulfilling life.

Thank you for visiting my website, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project.
